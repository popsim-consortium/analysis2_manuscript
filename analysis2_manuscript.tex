\section*{Abstract}
    \label{abstract}
    Natural selection is a fundamental evolutionary force that shapes patterns of genetic variation across species. 
    However, simulating realistic models that incorporate both selection and complex demographic histories
    is challenging, limiting our ability to benchmark statistical methods aimed at detecting selection and to explore theoretical predictions.
    \stdpopsim, a simulation library that provides an extensive catalog of population genetic models,
    aims to provide a standardized interface for simulating realistic models that incorporate both selection and complex demographic histories.
    Here we present a major extension to the \stdpopsim{} framework that enables simulation of various modes
    of natural selection, including background selection, selective sweeps, and arbitrary distributions of fitness effects (DFE).
    This extension maintains \stdpopsim's core principles of reproducibility and standardization while adding support
    for species-specific genomic annotations and published DFE estimates. 
    We demonstrate the utility of this framework by benchmarking methods for demographic inference,
    DFE estimation, and selective sweep detection across different species and scenarios. 
    Our results demonstrate the robustness of demographic inference methods to selection on linked sites, 
    reveal the sensitivity of DFE inference methods to model assumptions, 
    and show how genomic features like recombination rate and the density of functional sequence influence power to detect selective sweeps.
    This extension to \stdpopsim{} provides a powerful, new resource for the population genetics community
    to explore the interplay between selection and other evolutionary forces in a reproducible framework.

\section*{Introduction}
    \label{introduction}
    % natural selection
    Natural selection is a fundamental force in evolution, shaping the
    genetic diversity of populations and driving the adaptation of
    species to their environments. The effects of natural selection
    on genetic variation are complex, and can be difficult to disentangle
    from other evolutionary processes such as mutation, recombination,
    and genetic drift \citep[e.g.,][]{gillespie1991causes}.
    For instance, changes in population size can lead to fluctuations
    in genetic diversity across a recombining chromosome 
    that can mimic the effects of selection \citep{simonsen1995properties},
    and lead to spurious inferences about the strength and targets of genetic adaptation
    \citep{simonsen1995properties,akey2004population,nielsen2005genomic}.
    In turn, selection can confound our ability to infer demographic 
    history from allele frequencies \citep{ewing2016consequences,schrider2016effects} and
    estimates of inverse coalescent rate \citep{schrider2016effects, johri2021impact, cousins2024accurate}.
    Thus, it is imperative to jointly account for the effects of selection
    and demography when inferring evolutionary history from genetic data \citep[e.g.,][]{sheehan2016deep,johri2020toward},
    yet standardized tools for doing so remain limited.

    % simulation
    To meet the growing need for the interpretation,
    analysis, and exploration of realistic and complex evolutionary models
    the field of population genetics has increasingly turned to simulation.
    Simulation in population genetics has a long history 
    including both backward-in-time coalescent simulations
    \citep{kingman1982genealogy,hudson1983testing, hudson1990gene}
    and forward-in-time simulations of complex demography and selection
    \citep[e.g.,][]{gillespie1984molecular, hernandez2008flexible, thornton2014c++, haller2019slim}. 
    The development of simulation tools has been driven by the need to
    understand the effects of complex evolutionary processes on genetic
    variation \citep[e.g.,][]{peischl2013accumulation, thornton2019polygenic, galloway2020few, zhang2020impact}, 
     to provide a null model for hypothesis testing
    \citep[e.g.,][]{hudson1992statistical,hudson1994evidence,sabeti2002detecting},
    to explore the power and limitations of statistical methods \citep[e.g.,][]{przeworski2002signature},
    and increasingly to provide a basis for machine learning and other
    simulation-based inference methods 
    \citep[e.g.,][]{beaumont2002approximate,lin2011distinguishing,kern2018diplos,mughal2019localizing,sanchez2021deep,wang2021automatic, zhang2023maladapt, smith2023dispersenn2}.
    However, joint simulation of complex demography and selection
    is challenging, requiring a deep understanding of the underlying
    evolutionary processes, and necessitating a number of parameter choices including
    the strength of selection, the
    recombination rate, and a parameterized demographic model.
    This is a daunting task for many researchers, and can be a barrier to
    the adoption of simulation-based methods in population genetics.
    Furthermore, different simulation and inference tools may use different structures
    and parameter scalings for their models,
    making it difficult to directly compare across these tools and the studies that use them.
    
    % stdpopsim
    In light of the complexities associated with estimating and simulating
    population genetic models, it is no surprise that
    a lingering challenge with simulation in population genetics has been
    reproducibility and the ability to share and compare results among 
    researchers \citep[e.g.,][]{ragsdale2020lessons}.
    This challenge has been addressed in part by the development
    of community resources for sharing and distributing simulation software
    via the \stdpopsim project \citep{adrion2020community}. \stdpopsim
    provides a standardized interface for accessing a wide range of
    population genetic models, and has begun to be be widely adopted by the community 
    \citep[e.g.,][]{speidel2021inferring, wang2021automatic, yang2022trustgwas, degiorgio2022spatially, browning2023fast, schweiger2023ultrafast, temple2024modeling, haag2025pandora}.
    Yet, previous releases of \stdpopsim did not include
    models of selection, which is a major limitation for more empirically motivated
    applications of population genetic simulation. In particular, modeling selection
    through simulation is critical for understanding processes such
    as adaptation \citep[e.g.][]{thornton2019polygenic,hartfield2024polygenic}, the effects of selective sweeps 
    \citep[e.g.][]{braverman1995hitchhiking,fay2000hitchhiking,przeworski2002signature,przeworski2005signature,schrider2015soft}, 
    and the impact of background selection on genetic diversity
    \citep[e.g.][]{charlesworth1993effect,charlesworth1995pattern,williamson2002genealogy,ewing2016consequences,torres2020temporal}.
    Ideally, one would like
    to have a single, unified framework for simulating both neutral and
    non-neutral evolutionary processes and to be able to compare the
    results of these simulations to empirical data in a manner that is
    both accessible to a wide range of researchers and highly reproducible. 
    Furthermore, the framework should include the complex realities of 
    genomes, including heterogenous recombination rates, 
    variation in the size and density of functional elements, and
    non-equilibrium demographic histories. Moreover, one should be able
    to model all of these features simultaneously using estimates and annotations obtained
    from a species of interest \citep[e.g.][]{schrider2020background,rodrigues2024shared}.

    % goals
    Here, we provide an overview of a major new addition
    to \stdpopsim---the inclusion of models of selection.
    We begin by describing the models of selection that we have implemented,
    as well as the parameter choices that are available to the user.
    This includes models of background selection, selective sweeps, and
    models of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE).
    Further we describe how these models can be combined with genomic
    annotations that are specific to a given species available
    through the \stdpopsim API, and combined with a parameterized model of
    demography and recombination to provide a realistic simulation of
    genetic variation in a population.
    We then provide a series of examples of how these models can be used
    to benchmark and compare the performance of different methods for
    using genetic data to infer demographic history, the distribution of fitness effects,
    and the targets of recent positive selection. 

\section*{Implementing Selection in \stdpopsim}
    \label{selection}

    % implementing selection
    \stdpopsim previously provided a wide range of models of neutral
    demographic history from roughly two dozen species \citep{lauterbur2023expanding}.
    This was accomplished through the use of a standardized interface
    and data structure that allows for the curated addition of new
    species and models, and can use either
    \msprime \citep{Baumdicker2022} or \slim \citep{haller2019slim}
    as the backend engine for efficient population genetic simulation.
    To extend \stdpopsim's functionality to include models of selection, 
    we introduce two new classes
    to the \stdpopsim API: the \texttt{DFE} class and the \texttt{Annotation} class.
    The \texttt{DFE} class provides an interface for specifying
    a distribution of the fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations.
    Each \texttt{DFE} object specifies a list of mutation types and
    their proportions, where 
    each mutation type is associated with a dominance coefficient
    (currently limited to values between 0 and 1, inclusive),
    the distribution of selection coefficients (e.g., fixed-value, normally-distributed, gamma-distributed),
    and the parameters of this distribution.
    Each \texttt{Annotation} object represents a collection of functional
    genomic elements (e.g., exons, introns, intergenic regions, etc.)
    whose coordinates are specified using a GFF3 annotationfile.      
    More concretely, consider implementing a model of selection consistent with the
    DFE inferred by Kim et al. (\citeyear{kim2017inference}) for exons in the human genome.
    The associated \texttt{DFE} object is defined with two mutation types,
    neutral and deleterious, corresponding to synonymous and non-synonymous sites.
    with their proportions set to their expected prevalence in exons. 
    The neutral mutation type is associated with a fixed selection coefficient (0),
    and the deleterious mutation type is associated with a dominance coefficient of $0.5$ and
    a gamma-distributed selection coefficient
    with mean and shape as inferred by Kim et al. (\citeyear{kim2017inference}).
    \texttt{DFE} objects can also model a relationship between the selection and dominance coefficients \citep{huber2018gene}
    by defining ranges of selection coefficients and associating each range with a different dominance coefficient (see below).

        can be used in simulations. 
        \textbf{(B)} The python API and \textbf{(C)} the command line interface.
        The user specifies a species, a portion of
        the genome to simulate, and optionally a genetic map, a model of
        demography, and a model of selection that itself is composed of a
        distribution of fitness effects (DFE) and a set of functional
        annotations. }
    \end{figure}
    \kelcomment{For Figure 1 at the bottom, it says "Kyriazis et al. 2013". This should be "2023" instead}
    As with other aspects of \stdpopsim, we intend the selection models to be as biologically accurate as possible.
    Thus, the \stdpopsim catalog provides \texttt{Annotation} objects based on specices' publicly available functional genomic elements 
    and \texttt{DFE} objects based on published DFE estimates (Figure \ref{fig:schematic}A).
    By using annotation objects, one can, for example, simulate populations where selected mutations (whose selection
    coefficients are drawn from a specified DFE) occur within annotation regions (e.g. exons), while all mutations
    occurring outside of these regions do not affect fitness.
    There are relatively few species with published DFE estimates in the literature.
    \stdpopsim currently has implemented DFEs for four species in the catalogue:
    \textit{Arabidopsis thaleana} \citep{huber2018gene}, \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} \citep{ragsdale2016triallelic,huber2017determining},
    humans \citep{huber2017determining,kim2017inference}, and the vaquita porpoise \textit{Phocoena sinus} \citep{robinson2022critically}.
    While the DFEs are from a limited number of species, these DFEs can be applied to other species
    in the catalog if and when it is suitable. 
    For instance, one could simulate a butterfly species with a gamma-distributed DFE originally
    estimated from humans, or a human population with a DFE estimated from \textit{Drosophila}.
    Furthermore, the user can specify a custom DFE and provide their own annotations
    of functional elements to simulate selection in a species for which we do not yet have 
    a published DFE included in the catalog. This flexibility allows for a wide range of
    models of selection to be simulated. 
  
    From a user's perspective, a model of selection is specified by pairing a \texttt{DFE} object
    with a collection of genomic segments defined using an \texttt{Annotation} object.
    Multiple such pairings can be defined in one simulation
    to provide a rich model of how selection may vary along a chromosome.
    For example, coding sequences may be associated with one DFE and non-coding sequences in exons with another DFE.
    Simulations with selection are then implemented by specifying a species, 
    a portion of the genome to simulate,
    a genetic map if available, a model of demography, and pairings of DFEs with genomic segments
    using either the python API or the command-line interface (Figure \ref{fig:schematic}B-C).
    Simulations with selection are generated
    using the \slim simulation engine, which is perhaps
    the most flexible simulation engine for modeling selection available to date
    (\msprime's selection models are relatively limited and thus not currently used by \stdpopsim).

    % sweep interface
    In addition to the \texttt{DFE} class, we have also implemented a class (\texttt{stdpopsim.ext.selective\_sweep})
    that enables selective sweeps to be simulated in \stdpopsim.
    This class augments a demographic model with an ``extended event''
    which conditions on the introduction of a selected mutation at a given time and position
    and with a given selection coefficient. Further, the user can specify the minimum frequency
    of the selected allele at the time of sampling. As these extended events are implemented
    on top of the existing \stdpopsim API, they can be combined with other models of selection
    and demography to provide a model of the combined effects of multiple, disparate evolutionary processes
    on genetic variation in a population.
    

    % current numbers of DFEs / species / etc
    % ADK: check version number
    At this release (version 0.3) the \stdpopsim catalog comprises 27 species (i.e. genome representations)
    for which we have included 35 demographic models, 38 genetic maps, 12 DFEs, and 8 annotation objects. %ADK: checked this on 3/10/25
    Additions to the catalog are ongoing---we point the reader to our previously published 
    report detailing this effort \citep{lauterbur2023expanding}. We welcome contributions from the
    community and encourage those interested in contributing to visit https://popsim-consortium.github.io/stdpopsim-docs

%\section*{Example Applications with Selection}
%    \label{applications}
%    In this section, we present a series of examples of how the new models of selection
%    in \stdpopsim can be used to benchmark different
%    methods for population genetic inference.
%    We focus on three main areas: demographic inference in the 
%    single and multi-population settings, inference of the DFE,
%    and the detection of selective sweeps, particularly in the context of realistic recombination maps and background selection.

    \section*{Inference of $N_e(t)$ in the context of selection}
    One of the most common applications of population genetic inference is to estimate
    the effective population size over time, $N_e(t)$, from genetic data. This can be done
    using a variety of methods, including the sequential Markovian coalescent
    \citep{li2011inference,Schiffels2020,terhorst2017robust}, 
    %\igcomment{I'm not sure it's all that relevant, since it doesn't strictly infer N(t)}
    %\drscomment{One could use dadi for that, but then we should also cite things like fastsimcoal and ABC, while explaining
    % that users can use those methods to infer piecewise-constant N(t) histories as well with a prespecified number of epochs
    % and priors around their params, but maybe that is too much of a digression here? I'm fine either way}
    % ADK: I think we are good as is
    through use of the site frequency spectrum (SFS) \citep{liu2020stairway},
    as well as through identity by descent information \citep{santiago2020recent}.
    Since all of these methods assume neutrality, they are typically applied to genomic
    segments that are not expected to be directly affected by selection (e.g., by masking exons
    and conserved elements).
    However, natural selection acting on linked sites---even those that are masked out of the
    analysis---can bias estimates of $N_e(t)$
    away from census population sizes by increasing the 
    rate of coalescence in the genome \citep[e.g.][]{schrider2016effects}. 
    Using \stdpopsim, we can readily examine how different methods for inferring $N_e(t)$
    are influenced by selection on linked sites,
    which in the case of negative selection is commonly referred to as \emph{background selection}
    \citep{charlesworth1993effect,hudson1995deleterious}.

        Inference of $N_e(t)$ from human genomes simulated under an out-of-Africa demographic model \citep{ragsdale2019models}
        with and without purifying selection on exons. 
        Rows correspond to the three extant populations in the simulation: CHB, CEU, and YRI.
        Columns correspond to the four inference methods:    
        \msmc \citep{Schiffels2020}, \stairway \citep{liu2020stairway}, \gone \citep{santiago2020recent}, and \smcpp \citep{terhorst2017robust}.
        Each plot depicts the inferred $N_e(t)$ on the three datasets simulated without selection (blue)
        and the three datasets simulated with the background effects of purifying selection on exons (orange),
        alongside the true values of $N_e$ used in simulation (black).
        }
    \end{figure}

    To do this we simulated human genomes with and without natural selection.
    In both scenarios, we ran three replicate simulations
    under the out of Africa (OOA) demographic model of
    \citep{ragsdale2019models} using a genetic map from the HapMap Project \citep{international2007second} (see \textbf{Methods}).
    Simulations with selection were implemented by modeling purifying selection on nonsynonymous mutations
    using a DFE inferred by \cite{kim2017inference}.
    A basic summary of nucleotide diversity from these simulations is shown in Figure \ref{fig:homsap-summary-stats},
    which shows that the presence of selection decreases polymorphism in simulations with selection only slightly
    at the genome-wide level, but more substantially within exonic regions under both a constant population size
    and the out-of-Africa demographic model.
    Following the simulation, inference of $N_e(t)$ was conducted from each of the six simulated datasets using four methods: 1) \msmc \citep{Schiffels2020}, 
    2) \stairway \citep{liu2020stairway}, 3) \gone \citep{santiago2020recent}, and 4) \smcpp \citep{terhorst2017robust}.
    % IG: I commented this out because it appeared distracting. We can add a note in the end of this analysis
    % However, as a thorough benchmarking is not the main purpose of this manuscript, we saved computational resources by not conducting more simulation replicates.

    Although the estimates produced by the four methods differ from one another, 
    for each method the estimates produced from data with selection (Figure
    \ref{fig:human-demography}; orange) and without selection (Figure
    \ref{fig:human-demography}; blue) are fairly similar.
    Thus, this particular parameterization of background selection
    in combination with selection only at exonic sites in the out-of-Africa demographic model does not
    appear to notably bias the estimates produced by these methods.
    In light of Figure \ref{fig:human-demography}, this makes sense-- 
    the effect of selection is only apparent within exonic regions and presumably sites
    very closely linked, thus masking of exons should be sufficient to remove the effects of selection
    from our simulations. 
    As noted in previous studies that compared demography inference methods
    on neutral simulations \citep{adrion2020community},
    we see that each method has its strengths and weaknesses.
    Methods based on the sequential Markovian coalescent (\smcpp and \msmc)
    appear to produce the most accurate trajectories of $N_e(t)$ overall
    in this setting, although they tend to under-estimate the population
    bottleneck associated with the population split.
    On the other hand, \stairway, which utilizes the site frequency spectrum,
    produces more noisy estimates,
    but it does not appear to under-estimate the population bottleneck.
    The inference of \gone, which utilizes identity by descent,
    is targeted toward demographic changes in more recent time frames ($\sim 200$ generations),
    explaining its noisy estimates for all but the most recent time periods.

    To expand these observations to additional species and to highlight the ease of comparison enabled by \stdpopsim,
    we performed a similar benchmark using the vaquita porpoise \textit{Phocoena sinus}.
    We simulated 100 genomes under a two-epoch demographic model inferred for vaquita in \textcite{robinson2022critically},
    and a constant recombination rate across the genome (see \textbf{Methods}).
    In simulations with selection, we applied the DFE inferred by \textcite{robinson2022critically} to exons
    annotated from the vaquita genome assembly.
    This DFE model implements a relationship between selection and dominance 
    in which very deleterious mutations (with selection coefficient $s<-0.1$) are fully recessive
    (dominance coefficient $h=0$) and weakly deleterious mutations ($s\geq -0.001$) are nearly
    additive ($h=0.4$; see \textbf{Methods}).
    As above, a basic summary of nucleotide diversity from these simulations is shown in Figure \ref{fig:vaquita-summary-stats},
    which again shows that the presence of selection decreases polymorphism in simulations with selection, but that the effect
    is only readily apparent within exonic regions. Further in this case,
    we see that the two-epoch demographic model used in the simulations actually leads to a slight increase
    in diversity versus the constant population size model.
    
    In comparing demography inference methods, we see that the SFS-based method (\stairway) produces more accurate
    inference than the two methods based on the sequential Markovian coalescent 
    (\smcpp and \msmc; see Figure \ref{fig:vaquita-demography}).
    Regardless of these differences, we see that background selection again does not
    appear to considerably influence the inference of any of the four methods for this species,
    at least for the parameterization used here, 
    even though vaquita has a very different evolutionary history than humans.
    
    
    % MFR: Should we say somewhere that people use to expect from BGS? That is, that it can be seen as a reduction in local rates of coalescences and thus that we would expect these methods to be somewhat downwardly biased in the presence of BGS?
    % IG: we can address this in the discussion, or in the revised text above.

\section*{Estimation of the Distribution of Fitness effects}
    \label{dfe}
    Another common application of population genetic inference is to estimate the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations
    from genetic data. The new framework of modeling selection in \stdpopsim makes it an ideal tool for easily benchmarking and comparing
    the performance of different methods for inferring the DFE. 

    A challenge when comparing different inferred and simulated distributions of the selection coefficient ($s$)
    is differing conventions in the literature regarding its definition.
    The simulator \slim and the inference tool \grapes define the selection coefficient $s$ such that a homozygote has fitness $1+s$.
    On the other hand, \dadicli and \polydfe define the selection coefficient such that a homozygote has fitness $1+ 2s$.
     %https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/207/3/1103/5930676
    Moreover, inferred distributions of selection coefficients are typically scaled by an inferred ancestral
    effective population size $N_e$, and different methods assume different scaling.
    \dadicli infers the distribution of $2 N_e s$ while \polydfe and \grapes infer the distribution of $4 N_e s$.

    For comparison, here we have normalized all inference results to the convention of \slim (see \textbf{Methods}).

    \end{figure}

 

    We start by examining DFE inference from human genomes simulated under an out-of-Africa demographic model
    with selection acting on exons (see \textbf{Methods}).
    In this setting, the DFE is inferred separately for each of the three simulated populations
    using three different DFE inference methods: \dadicli \citep{Huang2023}, \polydfe \citep{tataru2020polydfe}, 
    and \grapes \citep{galtier2016adaptive}.
    In each case we note that the DFE is estimated from segregating sites only,
    without the use of substitution data, as \stdpopsim's models currently do not
    contain outgroup populations or species that can be used to estimate divergence.
     
    Overall, inferred DFEs varied across populations and inference methods (Figure \ref{fig:homsap-dfe.ooa}, Table \ref{tab:dfe_table}).
    Note that while the estimation accuracy for the DFE parameters themselves (Figure \ref{fig:homsap-dfe.ooa}A-B) is useful,
    examining the difference between the actual and inferred distributions of $s$ can be more helpful for showing how well a method
    has recovered the true DFE (Figure \ref{fig:homsap-dfe.ooa}C).
    The distributions of $s$ inferred by \polydfe and \dadicli had higher mean values (in absolute value)
    but smaller shape parameters, while \grapes inferred distributions with lower mean values and shape parameters.
    As a result, \polydfe and \dadicli over-estimate the fraction of mutations under strong selection ($s<-0.1$),
    while \grapes considerably over-estimates the fraction of mutations under weak selection ($s\geq-0.0001$).
    % IG: commented this out to simplify the basic observation
    % and under-estimates the fraction of mutations with $s<-0.01$.
    
    Population history appears to influence different methods in slightly different ways.
    For instance, \dadicli and \grapes produce more accurate estimates from the YRI genomes 
    (relative to the other two populations), whereas \polydfe
    produces its most accurate estimate from the CHB genomes.
    To factor out the influence of demographic changes, we also analyzed genomes generated using similar
    simulations but with no population size changes (Figure \ref{fig:homsap-dfe.constant}).
    In this simpler setting, \polydfe overlapped the true mean selection coefficient and shape parameter, whereas 
    the other methods do not. 
    \kelcomment{From looking at the SI Figure, these differences seem really slight. Also, with only 3 replicates, I think it's hard to conclusively say that some methods overlap the true values while others do not. I might instead just say here that all methods are close, but deviate slightly in different ways.
    \grapes exhibits similar biases without population size changes as in the simulations with more complex demography,
    but with milder under-estimation of the shape parameter, but \dadicli shows an inverse pattern
    with overestimated shape parameter and slightly underestimated mean. 
    As a sanity check, we also inferred the DFE from human genome simulations with a constant population size 
    (Figure \ref{fig:homsap-dfe.constant}, Table \ref{tab:dfe_table}), but largely the results are similar.

        acting on nonsynonymous mutations with a relationship between the selection coefficient ($s$) and dominance coefficient ($h$) (see \textbf{Methods}).
        The DFE is inferred by analyzing all simulated genomes jointly by one of three different methods:
        \grapes, \polydfe, and \dadicli.

        }
    \end{figure}

    Next, we benchmarked these three DFE-inference methods on simulations of the vaquita porpoise genome.
    Recall that these simulations apply a gamma-distributed selection coefficient to mutations in exons
    with a relationship between the selection and dominance coefficients (see \textbf{Methods}).
    In this setting, all methods perform uniformly worse than in the human genome simulations,
    with consistent underestimation of the mean selection coefficient    
    and overestimation of the shape parameter (Figure \ref{fig:vaquita-dfe}A-B, Table \ref{tab:dfe_table}). 
    Similar patterns are observed when re-running the simulations with a simpler demographic model
    without population size changes (Figure \ref{fig:vaquita-dfe.constant}, Table \ref{tab:dfe_table}).
    We suspect that this is due to the fact that all DFE inference methods used here assume an additive model ($h = \frac{1}{2}$),
    while mutations in the simulated genomes were more recessive ($h < \frac{1}{2}$), and their dominance decreased with the strength of selection. 
    To examine the influence of this model misspecification, we compared the inferred distributions of $s$ to the 
    simulated distribution of $2hs$, which would have been equal to $s$ under an additive model (Figure \ref{fig:vaquita-dfe}C).
    Reassuringly, all three methods infer distributions that appear to fit the main mode of the simulated distribution of $2hs$.
    This is likely because deleterious alleles are typically at low frequency and thus heterozygous, 
    where their selective effect is $h s$ rather than $s$.

\section*{Detection of Selective Sweeps}
    \label{sweeps}
    We next highlight how \stdpopsim can be used to benchmark and compare
    the performance of different methods for detecting selective sweeps from genetic data.
    Because simulation of selective sweeps is very time consuming and evaluation of statistical power requires
    many replicate simulations, we focused on human chromosome 1 and generated replicate simulations on 5cM segments
    of the chromosome in 100 different locations. % (see \textbf{Methods}).
    Selective sweeps were simulated by introducing a beneficial mutation in the center of the 5cM segment
    with a moderately strong selection coefficient ($s = 0.03$; $2Ns \sim 600$; see \textbf{Methods}).
    Each segment was simulated 1000 times, while keeping only replicates in which the selected allele reached a frequency of 0.95 or greater.
    These sweeps were modeled in the context of the three population out-of-Africa model from \cite{gutenkunst2009inferring}
    and background selection from deleterious mutations in exons.
    Sweep-detection methods typically base their inference on checking whether a test statistic
    exceeds a certain threshold, which is determined according to some empirical null distribution.
    In our simulations, we considered two different null distributions:
    one based on neutral simulations, and another based on simulations with background selection
    from deleterious mutations in exons (see \textbf{Methods}).

        2) \diploshic \citep{kern2018diplos} (middle row),

        and a null model with background selection from deleterious mutations in exons (red).
        Also shown are heatmaps of exon density and local recombination rate along the
        chromosome (bottom).

        }
        \label{fig:chr1_power}
    \end{figure}
   
    We evaluated the statistical power to detect selective sweeps for three methods:
    1) \sweepfinder \citep{degiorgio2016sweepfinder2},
    2) \diploshic \citep{kern2018diplos},
    and 3) reduced diversity ($\pi$).
    For each method, we determined a threshold for its test-statistic 
    using each of the two null models separately (neutral and BGS) and controlling 
    for a $5\%$ false positive rate.

    We then applied each method to data simulated with sweeps for two samples (YRI and CEU)
    in each of 100 locations along human chromosome 1 (Figure \ref{fig:chr1_power}).
    First, we notice that power to detect sweeps is slightly lower when the test statistic threshold
    is determined using simulated data with background selection (BGS null model).
    %This observation is consistent with what was previously shown by \cite{schrider2020background},
    %but the effect is relatively minor. DRS: cutting this because my paper showed that power decreases when our test set has BGS and our training set does not, so not quite the same.
    This is likely because the strength of selection acting on exons is relatively weak, and the
    sweep detection methods we have used are relatively robust to the effects of background selection. 
    Second, the power to detect sweeps is generally higher in the YRI sample
    than in the CEU sample, which is consistent with the fact that YRI has a larger ancestral effective population size and
    thus both stronger selection and more variation to detect a sweep \citep[e.g.,][]{simonsen1995properties}.
    Conversely, the CEU population experienced the out-of-Africa bottleneck that may mute the signal of a sweep.  
    Finally and most importantly, the power to detect sweeps varies considerably along the chromosome,
    and this variation is much greater than the variation in power between CEU and YRI or between
    null models. This is likely due to the effects of recombination rate heterogeniety (Figure \ref{fig:chr1_power}).% as well
    %as the density of functional elements along the chromosome.
    %DRS: cut the density of func elements because that stuff doesn't seem to matter much here

    We compared the overall performance of the three sweep-detection methods using
    receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (Figure \ref{fig:roc-curves}).
    Different methods perform better for each of the sampled populations,
    with \sweepfinder performing better than the other two on the CEU sample,
    and \diploshic performing better on the YRI sample.
    This is may result from the fact that we trained \diploshic on simulations under a constant size population,
    which more closely matches the demographic history of YRI, than that of CEU, which 
    is characterized by a strong recent bottleneck followed by population expansion.
    %\drscomment{note: I am couching the language above a bit because we have previously shown that shic doesn't suffer in the sweep vs. nonsweep question when doing other train-on-constant-test-on-nonequilib benchmarks. Could be something else going on here (or some interaction between demog misspec and rec rate variation), but in any case I am not certain of the cause so I am toning down our certainty slightly.}
    Interestingly, the simple method that uses reduced diversity ($\pi$) as an indicator
    for a selective sweep performs reasonably well overall (especially on the CEU sample).
    However, its accuracy is much more variable along the chromosome compared to the other two method (see Figure \ref{fig:chr1_power}),
    and for quite a few locations along the chromosome it has power below $50\%$
    when applied to both sample sets.
    In that sense, \sweepfinder appears to have the least variation in power along the chromosome or across populations.

        }
        \label{fig:power-recomb}
    \end{figure}

    To further dissect the reasons for high variance along the chromosome in power to detect sweeps,
    we examined the relationship between power and local recombination rate for our sweep simulations ( Figure \ref{fig:power-recomb}).
    We see that power to detect sweeps is
    a decreasing function of local recombination rate for \sweepfinder and reduced diversity,
    which is consistent with sweeps having a larger genomic footprint in regions of low
    recombination.
    \diploshic on the other hand shows a slight increase in power with recombination rates,
    presumably because it is designed to distinguish regions where a sweep happened from regions linked to a sweep,
    and if the recombination rate is too low (or selection too strong) then the genomic window examined by \diploshic may
    not be large enough to exhibit enough of a recovery in patterns of diversity flanking the sweep.
    These results confirm that reduced genetic diversity performs well as an indicator for selective sweeps only in regions with
    low recombination rate.
    The other two methods, which were specifically designed for sweep detection, are considerably more robust 
    to the effects of recombination rate than the simple indicator of reduced genetic diversity.
    These methods are particularly robust to recombination rate variation when applied to 
    the YRI sample, especially when using a neutral null model to calibrate the test statistics.
    The other null model, which assumes background selection from exons,
    appears to consistently lead to reduced power for detecting sweeps regardless of the recombination rate.
    Interestingly, we do not see a clear correlation between power to detect sweeps and
    local exon density (Figure \ref{fig:power-exon}).
    This is somewhat surprising given that background selection is expected to somewhat interfere with the sweep signature.
    This might suggest that the effects of realistic background selection on genome variation
    may not be as similar to those of sweeps as previously thought \citep{schrider2020background}.

\section*{Discussion}
    \label{Discussion}
    In this paper, we have presented an important new addition to the \stdpopsim{} library
    that allows for simulating genetic variation in the presence of selection.
    We have demonstrated the utility of this new API by showing how it can be used to benchmark
    the performance of different methods for demographic history inference, the inference of the distribution
    of fitness effects of new mutations, and the detection of selective sweeps.
    In general, this is an important step forward for the field of population genetics,
    as it allows for a wide range of models of selection to be easily simulated and compared to
    empirical data, with reproducibility, computational efficiency, and rigor.

    The exploration of performance among methods done here is not meant to be thorough 
    benchmarking, but instead meant to highlight the utility of the \stdpopsim resource. 
    Having said that, there are a number of interesting results that bear discussion. 
    The first pertains to estimation of demographic history ($N_e(t)$) in the context of
    linked purifying selection. Our genomic simulations of humans and vaquita that incorporate
    selection model published DFEs that operate at exonic positions of the genome only. 
    As shown in Figures \ref{fig:homsap-summary-stats} and \ref{fig:vaquita-summary-stats},
    this combination only produces sizeable decreases in polymorphism at exonic positions, 
    which represent a small minority of sites within the genome, and does not lead to large-scale
    perturbations in genome-wide diversity. Thus it is not surprising that estimates of $N_e(t)$
    from genome-wide data from which exons have been masked should be accurate 
    (e.g., Figures \ref{fig:human-demography} and \ref{fig:vaquita-demography}). 
    However the question remains to what extent this would be true in empirical data where
    selection is not constrained to coding positions. For instance, we know
    that many genomes harbor large numbers
    of conserved non-coding elements \citep[e.g.,]{siepel2005evolutionarily} with extremely
    strong selection acting on them \citep{katzman2007human,mclean2008dispensability},
    thus we caution extrapolating from our simulation results. Future studies might build upon
    the annotations we used here to include selection at other portions of the genome as well
    as mixtures of DFEs across sites. 

    A second important finding we made using the new stdpopsim selection API is that inference of the DFE
    is sensitive to the dominance of deleterious mutations.
    All three of the inference methods of the DFE applied here assume that deleterious mutations act
    in an additive fashion ($h=0.5$) by default.
    However, the simulated DFE for the vaquita genome included highly recessive mutations.
    Specifically, these simulations used a DFE where mutations with $s<-0.01$ are quite recessive, 
    with $h<=0.01$, and where mutations with $-0.001<s<-0.01$ have $h=0.1$.
    We found that the three DFE inference methods underestimated $E[s]$ and overestimated the shape parameter (Figure \ref{fig:vaquita-dfe}).
    This performance is not surprising as decreasing $h$ for a given distribution of $s$ will lead to a decrease in $hs$,
    or an apparent decrease in the amount of selection.
    Fitting a mis-specified DFE that assumes $h=0.5$ will then lead to underestimates of $E[s]$.
    Indeed, the distribution of $hs$ is much more accurately estimated (Figure \ref{fig:vaquita-dfe}b).
    Overall, these results are consistent with prior work showing that it is challenging to separately
    infer the DFE of $s$ along with $h$ \citep{veeramah2014evidence, kyriazis2024constraining, balick2022overcoming}
    and that a large proportion ($>5\%$) of recessive deleterious mutations can confound inferences of $s$ \citep{wade2023quantifying}.
    Given the plethora of evidence for recessive deleterious mutations 
    \citep{mukai1972mutation, agrawal2011inferences, huber2018gene, di2024revisiting,},
    these results suggest the need for care in DFE inference.
    Kyriazis and Lohmueller \citeyear{kyriazis2024constraining} inferred the DFE of $s$ for nonsynonymous mutations
    in humans when considering different values of $h$.
    Intriguingly, additive models showed a satisfactory fit to the SFS of nonsynonymous variants in humans
    and more complex models of dominance did not substantially improve the fit.
    Nevertheless, models including recessive deleterious mutations, like those simulated here for the vaquita genome,
    show a similar fit to the SFS and may be more biologically realistic than fully additive models,
    given the evidence for the presence of recessive deleterious mutations.
    More broadly, new computational approaches are needed to precisely quantify the DFE and the covariance of $h$ and $s$.

    Further, inference of the DFE was done here using exon annotations of the genome in question.
    A key distinction between our analyses and those done in practice
    is that we have complete knowledge of which sites are under selection in the simulation,
    thus our inferences represent a best case scenario. Empirical inference of the DFE is a much
    harder problem as some mutations assumed to be free of selection
    may in reality be under selection.

    Regarding sweep detection, the inclusion of selection models into \stdpopsim allowed us to readily compare the
    effectiveness of different methods on data reflecting the demographic history, recombination rate variation,
    and genomic locations of negatively selected sites present in human populations. These results clearly demonstrate
    the impact of recombination rate variation, and underscore the importance of training methods on data with variable
    recombination rates \citep[e.g.,][]{schrider2017soft}. In addition, our results
    illustrate a strength of likelihood methods like \sweepfinder, that do not require a predefined window size.
    Window-based methods, such as \diploshic, tend to lag in performance when the perturbation due to a sweep is at 
    a much greater or smaller scale than the chosen window size, as can occur with very strong sweeps or low levels of 
    recombination. Moreover while all the methods examined here retain adequate power for sweep identification across
    scenarios, including the inclusion of background selection, our results underscore the importance of developing 
    methods that are well powered in the face of unknown demographic histories. Indeed, the largest differences
    in power we observed across simulated scenarios were between demographic histories and not the inclusion of background
    selection. 

    Although we have shown how the new \stdpopsim API can be used to benchmark the performance of different methods,
    the benchmarks shown here merely scratch the surface of what can be done with the new API.
    We envision that, moving forward, many researchers will use
    the new API to simulate data under a wide range of models of selection, demography, and genome architecture, and to develop
    new methods for the analysis of genetic data in the presence of selection. 
    The additions to \stdpopsim described here further expand this tool's utility for both 
    characterizing the patterns of diversity expected under a wide range of population genetic
    models, and for benchmarking methods for the analysis of genetic data
    on common ground in a way that was not possible before.

\section*{Methods}
    \label{methods}

    \subsection*{Whole genome simulations}
    In this study we performed simulations of the human and vaquita porpoise genomes
    using the \stdpopsim{} framework. We ran replicate datasets for each genome/parameter combination,
    in which chromosomes were simulated separately from one another.
    All simulations were executed using the \slim engine with a burn-in of $10N$ generations
    (where $N$ is the initial population size), and a scaling factor of 1 (no scaling).
    All simulations were implemented using as part of a \snakemake workflow,
    where the code utilized is similar to the one shown in Figure 1B.
    The complete simulation workflow is available at \url{https://github.com/popsim-consortium/analysis2/blob/main/workflows/simulation.snake}
    (see \textbf{Data availablity} below).


    \subsubsection*{Simulations of complete human genomes}
    Simulation of human genomes used a genetic map from the HapMap Project
    \citep{international2007second} (\stdpopsim label \texttt{HapMapII\_GRCh38}) and
    the out of Africa (OOA) demographic model with archaic admixture from
    \cite{ragsdale2019models} (\stdpopsim label \texttt{OutOfAfricaArchaicAdmixture\_5R19}).
    Simulations with selection additionally applied a DFE model with gamma-distributed selection coefficients inferred by
    \cite{kim2017inference} (\stdpopsim label \texttt{Gamma\_K17}) to exons annotated by the HAVANA group release 104
    (\cite{ensembl2018}; \stdpopsim label \texttt{ensembl\_havana\_104\_exons}).
    Each simulation generated 100 diploid genomes from each of the three extant human populations (YRI, CEU, and CHB),
    with each genome consisting of 22 autosomes.
    Using these settings, we generated three replicate datasets without selection
    and three replicate datasets with selection.
    Three additional datasets, used in Figure \ref{fig:homsap-dfe.constant},
    were simulated with the same model of selection and a simple demographic model with one population with a constant size of $10,000$.
    Each of these simulations generated 100 diploid genomes.
    The configuration file used in combination with our \snakemake workflow
    for these simulations can be found at \url{https://github.com/popsim-consortium/analysis2/blob/main/workflows/config/snakemake/production_config_HomSap.yml}.
    
    \subsubsection*{Simulations of complete vaquita porpoise genomes}
    Simulation of vaquita porpoise genomes used 
    the two-epoch demographic model from \cite{robinson2022critically} (\stdpopsim label \texttt{Vaquita2Epoch\_1R22}).
    Since no genetic map is currently available for this species, we assumed a constant recombination rate of  $10^{-8}$
    across all chromosomes \citep{morin2021}.
    Simulations with selection additionally applied a DFE model with gamma-distributed selection coefficients inferred by
    \cite{robinson2022critically} (\stdpopsim label \texttt{Gamma\_R22}) to exons annotated from the vaquita genome assembly
    (\cite{morin2021}; \stdpopsim label \texttt{Phocoena\_sinus.mPhoSin1.pri.110\_exons}).
    This DFE model implements a relationship between selection and dominance as follows:
    very deleterious mutations (with $s<-0.1$) were set to be recessive ($h=0$),
    mutations with $s\in [-0.1,-0.01)$ were set to have a dominance coefficient of $h=0.01$,
    mutations with $s\in [-0.01,-0.001)$ were set to have a dominance coefficient of $h=0.1$,
    and very mild mutations (with $s\in [-0.001,0)$) were set to have a nearly additive effect ($h=0.4$).
    This approach is similar to what was used in the simulations cunducted by \textcite{robinson2022critically}
    and is easily implemented in \stdpopsim's \texttt{DFE} class.
    Each simulation generate 100 diploid genomes,
    with each genome consisting of 21 autosomes.
    Using these settings, we generated three replicate datasets without selection
    and three replicate datasets with selection.
    Three additional datasets, used in Figure \ref{fig:vaquita-dfe.constant},
    were simulated with the same model of selection and a simple demographic model with one population with a constant size of $3,500$.
    \igcomment{If we end up using Fig. S3, then we should add a line describing it's simulation here.}
    The configuration file used in combination with our \snakemake workflow
    for these simulations can be found at 
    \url{https://github.com/popsim-consortium/analysis2/blob/main/workflows/config/snakemake/production_config_PhoSin.yml}.


    \subsection*{Inference of $N_e(t)$}
    Inference of $N_e(t)$ was conducted on simulated datasets after masking non-recombining portions
    of the genome (to avoid bias caused by extreme recombination rate variation)
    and exons (to avoid the direct effect of natural selection).
    Thus, inference from datasets simulated with selection was not influenced by direct selection
    acting on exons, but it was influenced by selection acting on linked sites (background selection).    

    We assessed the accuracy of demographic inferences from three software packages:
    \msmc \citep{Schiffels2020}, \stairway \citep{liu2020stairway}, \gone \citep{santiago2020recent},
    and \smcpp \citep{terhorst2017robust}.
    For \msmc \citep{Schiffels2020}, we used a random sample of $N=6$ simulated genomes with 20
    iterations of the EM algorithm.
    For \gone \citep{santiago2020recent}, we set \texttt{max\_snps} to 500,000,
    the number of generations to 2,000, and the number of bins to 400, all representing default settings.
    For \stairway \citep{liu2020stairway} we did one run of theta estimation for each replicate dataset,
    and used a `dimFactor' of 5000, both of which represent default settings.
    For \smcpp \citep{terhorst2017robust} we used the unfolded SFS (`--unfold'), 
    along with the true mutation rate under which the simulations were generated. 
    The complete \snakemake workflow for demographic inference can be found at
    \url{https://github.com/popsim-consortium/analysis2/blob/main/workflows/n_t.snake}.
    

    \subsection*{DFE inference}
    % ADK: I've tried to deal with all the comments here    
    We used three software packages to infer the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) from genetic data:
    \dadicli \citep{Huang2023,kim2017inference}, \polydfe \citep{tataru2020polydfe}, and \grapes \citep{galtier2016adaptive}.
    Each software package was run using the same set of simulations.
    The DFE inference using \dadicli was conducted by first inferring a demographic model from neutral sites,
    using a two epoch demographic model with 100 repeated runs of the optimization procedure.
    \dadicli then proceeds by using a cached strategy wherein we used 2000 points in the $gamma$ distribution.
    Finally, the DFE was inferred using a ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations of 2.31, again with 
    100 repeated runs of the optimization procedure.
    For \polydfe, we used model 'C' which uses a mixture of a gamma distribution and an exponential distribution,
    where the gamma component is used for negatively selected mutations. For optimization we used
    the default BFGS optimizer with the '-e' flag to automatically estimate the initial parameters values.
    For \grapes, we inferred the DFE under the `GammaZero' model, which assumes that selection coefficients
    are drawn from a single gamma distribution. We used the `-no-div-param' flag to disable the use
    of divergence-based parameter estimation. All other settings were left at their default values.
    All methods used the same exon annotations as generated in the simulations. The total number of coding sites
    in the human and vaquita genomes used were 61,644,801 and 31,039513 respectively.

    % ADK: I've added a section below that describes the DFE inference methods used in this study.
    For comparison among methods, estimates were rescaled. 
    As described above, each DFE-inference method scales selection coefficients slightly differently.
    We thus rescaled each program's output to obtain a selection coefficient ($s$) consistent with the one used by \slim.
    The output of \grapes  was scaled by a factor of  $\mu / \theta$,
    and the output of \polydfe was saled by $2 \mu / \theta$, 
    where $\mu$ is the assumed mutation rate and 
    $\theta$ is the population-scaled mutation rate estimated by each method ($\theta = 4N_{e}\mu$).
    For \dadicli, the gamma distribution is parameterized using the shape and rate ($\alpha$ and $\nu$, respectively). 
    The mean value of the distribution, which is $s$ is transformed from $\alpha$ and $\nu$ and rescaled as $\alpha * \nu / (\theta / (4 \mu L p))$,
    where $L$ is the total number of sites available for the analysis,
    and $p$ is the proportion of sites under selection.
    Complete details for the DFE inference analysis can be found in the
    \snakemake workflow at \url{https://github.com/popsim-consortium/analysis2/blob/main/workflows/dfe.snake}.



    \subsection*{Simulations with selective sweeps}

    To test methods for detecting selective sweeps, we simulated 100 evenly distributed 5cM
    segments of human chromosome 1.
    As recombination rate varies across the genome, the size of the region in base pairs simulated varied, however the recombination distance,
    which is critical for the linked effects of a sweep, was held constant.
    Each segment was simulated in each of the following three settings:
    (1) neutral, (2) background selection (BGS), and (3) hard sweep with BGS.
    In all three settings, we applied a genetic map from the HapMap Project
    \citep{international2007second} (\stdpopsim label \texttt{HapMapII\_GRCh38}) and
    the three-population out of Africa (OOA) demographic model from
    \cite{gutenkunst2009inferring} (\stdpopsim label \texttt{OutOfAfrica\_3G09}).
    In the two settings with BGS, we applied the DFE model with gamma-distributed selection coefficients inferred by
    \cite{kim2017inference} (\stdpopsim label \texttt{Gamma\_K17}) to exons annotated by the HAVANA group release 104
    (\cite{ensembl2018}; \stdpopsim label \texttt{ensembl\_havana\_104\_exons}).
    Hard sweeps were modeled by generating a single beneficial mutation 
    with selection coefficient of $s = 0.03$ in the center of the 5cM genomic segment
    and discarding simulations in which the beneficial mutation did not reach (or exceed) a terminal frequency of $95\%$.
    For each of the 100 genomic segments of chromosome 1, we generated 1,000 replicate datasets under each of the three settings.
    As with the whole-genome simulations (see above), we used the \slim engine with a burn-in of $2N$ generations
    (where $N$ is the initial population size), and a scaling factor of 2.
    Each simulation generated 10 diploid genomic segments for each of the two sampled populations: YRI and CEU.
    The sequences simulated with a hard sweep and BGS were used for sweep detection,
    and sequences simulated under the other two settings were used to calibrate the thresholds of the test statistics
    used by the three sweep-detection methods (see below).

    \subsection*{Selective sweeps detection}
    
    Each of the three sweep-detection methods is based on a test statistic.
    Reduced nucleotide diversity is based on nucleotide diversity  ($\pi$) 
    computed directly from the underlying tree sequences using \tskit \citep{ralph2020efficiently}
    over 10 equally sized and non-overlapping subwindows.
    \sweepfinder \citep{degiorgio2016sweepfinder2} is based on a composite likelihood ratio (CLR) 
    computed at 21 uniformly distributed positions along the simulated region.
    \diploshic \citep{kern2018diplos} uses supervised learning to train a sweep classifier.
    Its training phase used \texttt{discoal} \citep{kern2016discoal} to simulate 20 haploid sequences of length 1.21Mbp
    with a constant population size of $N_e=10,000$, a mutation rate of $2\times 10^{-8}$, and a recombination rate of $2\times 10^{-8}$.
    For \texttt{discoal} simulations that included selective sweeps,
    selection coefficients were drawn from a uniform distribution between $0.001$ and $0.10$,
    and the time of the sweep was chosen from a uniform distribution between $0$ and $0.01N_e$ generations in the past.
    For soft sweeps, the frequency at which selection was introduced was drawn from a uniform distribution between $0.0001$ and $0.1$.
    We note that since the training set of \diploshic was generated under a simple model with
    constant mutation and recombination rates and constant effective population size,
    we expect it to perform suboptimally on the simulated segments of human chromosome 1,
    which were generated using more relaistic simulations (see \textbf{Simulations with selective sweeps} above).

    The three sweep-detection methods were associated with thresholds for their respective test statistics
    ($\pi$, \sweepfinder's CLR, or \diploshic's probability),
    which were determined using an empirical distribution representing a null model without sweeps.
    We considered two null models: a neutral evolution model (neutral),
    and a model with background selection from deleterious mutations in exons (BGS).
    Each null model was represented by a different set of $100,000$ simulations generated according to the appropriate model
    (see \textbf{Simulations with selective sweeps} above).
    Thus, for each test statistic we determined two thresholds corresponding to these two different null models (neutral and BGS)
    using the extreme $5\%$ quantile in each empirical distribution.
    Simulated regions where the central 1Mb had a recombination rate of less than $10^{-3}cM$ were excluded from the analysis.
    This excluded 7 regions from the analysis. 
    Then, power (or true positive rate) to detect a sweep by a given method was determined for
    100 evenly-spaced positions on chromosome 1 as follows:
    each sweep-detection method was applied to the 1,000 
    simulated datasets generated with a hard sweep (neutral and BGS) for that position,
    and the power was set to be the proportion of simulations (out of 1,000)
    in which the test statistic exceeded the threshold determined by each of the two null models (neutral and BGS).
    We note that using an empirical distribution to determine the threshold for calling a selective
    sweep with \diploshic deviates from the original implementation of the method,
    however for consistency among methods we chose to take this approach.
