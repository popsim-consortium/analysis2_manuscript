    abstract = {Author Summary Evolutionary adaptation is a process in which beneficial mutations increase in frequency in response to selective pressures. If these mutations were previously rare or absent from the population, adaptation should generate a characteristic signature in the genetic diversity around the adaptive locus, known as a selective sweep. Such selective sweeps can be distinguished into hard selective sweeps, where only a single adaptive mutation rises in frequency, or soft selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive mutations at the same locus sweep through the population simultaneously. Here we design a new statistical method that can identify both hard and soft sweeps in population genomic data and apply this method to a Drosophila melanogaster population genomic dataset consisting of 145 sequenced strains collected in North Carolina. We find that selective sweeps were abundant in the recent history of this population. Interestingly, we also find that practically all of the strongest and most recent sweeps show patterns that are more consistent with soft rather than hard sweeps. We discuss the implications of these findings for the discovery and quantification of adaptation from population genomic data in Drosophila and other species with large population sizes.},

	abstract = {The theory of genetic hitchhiking predicts that the level of genetic variation is greatly reduced at the site of strong directional selection and increases as the recombinational distance from the site of selection increases. This characteristic pattern can be used to detect recent directional selection on the basis of DNA polymorphism data. However, the large variance of nucleotide diversity in samples of moderate size imposes difficulties in detecting such patterns. We investigated the patterns of genetic variation along a recombining chromosome by constructing ancestral recombination graphs that are modified to incorporate the effect of genetic hitchhiking. A statistical method is proposed to test the significance of a local reduction of variation and a skew of the frequency spectrum caused by a hitchhiking event. This method also allows us to estimate the strength and the location of directional selection from DNA sequence data.},

In humans, pedigree analysis has documented variation at the chromosomal level, and sperm studies have identified specific hotspots in which crossing-over events cluster. To address whether this picture is representative of the genome as a whole, we have developed and validated a method for estimating recombination rates from patterns of genetic variation. From extensive single-nucleotide polymorphism surveys in European and African populations, we find evidence for extreme local rate variation spanning four orders in magnitude, in which 50\% of all recombination events take place in less than 10\% of the sequence. We demonstrate that recombination hotspots are a ubiquitous feature of the human genome, occurring on average every 200 kilobases or less, but recombination occurs preferentially outside genes.},

These data contain a wealth of information about the demographic history of the populations from which they originate. Many sophisticated statistical inference procedures have been developed to infer the demographic history of populations from this type of genomic data. In this review, we discuss the different statistical methods available for inference of demography, providing an overview of the underlying theory and logic behind each approach. We also discuss the types of data required and the pros and cons of each method. We then discuss how these methods have been applied to a variety of nonmodel organisms. We conclude by presenting some recommendations for researchers looking to use genomic data to infer demographic history. }

@article{andrews2016radseq,
abstract = {RADseq has fuelled studies in ecological, evolutionary and conservation genomics by using next-generation sequencing to uncover hundreds or thousands of polymorphic loci across the genome in a single, simple and cost-effective experiment. RADseq does not require any prior genomic information for the taxa being studied, and is therefore particularly advantageous for studies of non-model organisms.Numerous technical variations on RADseq have been developed, which promise to increase the flexibility and decrease the cost and effort of genomics studies. Differences among the methods lead to important considerations for all steps of genomics studies, from the types of scientific questions that can be addressed and the costs of library preparation and sequencing to the types of bias and error that are inherent in the resulting data.Allele dropout, PCR duplicates and variance in depth of coverage among loci are important sources of error and bias in RADseq studies, and the prevalence of these phenomena will vary across RADseq methods.Other important considerations when designing a RADseq study include the number, length and coverage of loci needed to address the research question; the availability of prior genomic resources; the budget; and the consistency of data across sequencing runs and laboratories.There is no single best or most flexible RADseq method. Researchers must consider the trade-offs of the different methods, and choose the approach that is best suited to their study goals.},

	abstract = {The genetic study of diverging, closely related populations is required for basic questions on demography and speciation, as well as for biodiversity and conservation research. However, it is often unclear whether divergence is due simply to separation or whether populations have also experienced gene flow. These questions can be addressed with a full model of population separation with gene flow, by applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for estimating the posterior probability distribution of model parameters. We have generalized this method and made it applicable to data from multiple unlinked loci. These loci can vary in their modes of inheritance, and inheritance scalars can be implemented either as constants or as parameters to be estimated. By treating inheritance scalars as parameters it is also possible to address variation among loci in the impact via linkage of recurrent selective sweeps or background selection. These methods are applied to a large multilocus data set from Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. The species are estimated to have diverged \~{}500,000 years ago. Several loci have nonzero estimates of gene flow since the initial separation of the species, with considerable variation in gene flow estimates among loci, in both directions between the species.},

In this paper, we describe a way to record all of these relationships, as well as how genetic material is passed down through the pedigree, during a forwards-time population genetic simulation. To make effective use of this information, we describe both efficient storage methods for this embellished pedigree as well as a way to remove all information that is irrelevant to the genetic history of a given set of individuals, which dramatically reduces the required amount of storage space. Storing this information allows us to produce whole-genome sequence from simulations of large populations in which we have not explicitly recorded new genomic mutations; we find that this results in computational run times of up to 50 times faster than simulations forced to explicitly carry along that information.},

	abstract = {The effect of a mutation on fitness may differ between populations, depending on environmental and genetic context. Experimental studies have shown that such differences exist, but little is known about the broad patterns of such differences or the factors that drive them. To quantify genome-wide patterns of differences in mutation fitness effects, we extended the concept of a distribution of fitness effects (DFE) to a joint DFE between populations. To infer the joint DFE, we fit parametric models that included demographic history to genomic data summarized by the joint allele frequency spectrum. Using simulations, we showed that our approach is statistically powerful and robust to many forms of model misspecification. We then applied our approach to populations of Drosophila melanogaster, wild tomatoes, and humans. We found that mutation fitness effects are overall least correlated between populations in tomatoes and most correlated in humans, corresponding to overall genetic differentiation. In D. melanogaster and tomatoes, mutations in genes involved in immunity and stress response showed the lowest correlation of fitness effects, consistent with environmental influence. In D. melanogaster and humans, deleterious mutations showed a lower correlation of fitness effects than tolerated mutations, hinting at the complexity of the joint DFE. Together, our results show that the joint DFE can be reliably inferred and that it offers extensive insight into the genetics of population divergence.},

	abstract = {Recent genome sequencing studies with large sample sizes in humans have discovered a vast quantity of low-frequency variants, providing an important source of information to analyze how selection is acting on human genetic variation. In order to estimate the strength of natural selection acting on low-frequency variants, we have developed a likelihood-based method that uses the lengths of pairwise identity-by-state between haplotypes carrying low-frequency variants. We show that in some non-equilibrium populations (such as those that have had recent population expansions) it is possible to distinguish between positive or negative selection acting on a set of variants. With our new framework, one can infer a fixed selection intensity acting on a set of variants at a particular frequency, or a distribution of selection coefficients for standing variants and new mutations. We apply our method to the UK10K phased haplotype dataset of 3,781 individuals and find a similar proportion of neutral, moderately deleterious, and deleterious variants compared to previous estimates made using the site frequency spectrum. We discuss several interpretations for this result, including that selective constraints have remained constant over time.},

abstract = {Quantifying the distribution of fitness effects among newly arising mutations in the human genome is key to resolving important debates in medical and evolutionary genetics. Here, we present a method for inferring this distribution using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from a population with non-stationary demographic history (such as that of modern humans). Application of our method to 47,576 coding SNPs found by direct resequencing of 11,404 protein coding-genes in 35 individuals (20 European Americans and 15 African Americans) allows us to assess the relative contribution of demographic and selective effects to patterning amino acid variation in the human genome. We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in the sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent bottleneck in the sample with European ancestry. After accounting for these demographic effects, we find strong evidence for great variability in the selective effects of new amino acid replacing mutations. In both populations, the patterns of variation are consistent with a leptokurtic distribution of selection coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near neutrality. Specifically, we predict 27-29{\%} of amino acid changing (nonsynonymous) mutations are neutral or nearly neutral (vertical bar s vertical bar {\textless} 0.01{\%}), 30-42{\%} are moderately deleterious (0.01{\%}, vertical bar s vertical bar, 1{\%}), and nearly all the remainder are highly deleterious or lethal (vertical bar s vertical bar. 1{\%}). Our results are consistent with 10-20{\%} of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees having been fixed by positive selection with the remainder of differences being neutral or nearly neutral. Our analysis also predicts that many of the alleles identified via whole-genome association mapping may be selectively neutral or (formerly) positively selected, implying that deleterious genetic variation affecting disease phenotype may be missed by this widely used approach for mapping genes underlying complex traits.},

@article{Barroso2019,
abstract = {Understanding the causes and consequences of recombination landscape evolution is a fundamental goal in genetics that requires recombination maps from across the tree of life. Such maps can be obtained from population genomic datasets, but require large sample sizes. Alternative methods are therefore necessary to research organisms where such datasets cannot be generated easily, such as non-model or ancient species. Here we extend the sequentially Markovian coalescent model to jointly infer demography and the spatial variation in recombination rate. Using extensive simulations and sequence data from humans, fruit-flies and a fungal pathogen, we demonstrate that iSMC accurately infers recombination maps under a wide range of scenarios�remarkably, even from a single pair of unphased genomes. We exploit this possibility and reconstruct the recombination maps of ancient hominins. We report that the ancient and modern maps are correlated in a manner that reflects the established phylogeny of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and modern human populations.},

	abstract = {Meiotic recombination in mammals has been shown to largely cluster into hotspots, which are targeted by the chromatin modifier PRDM9. The canid family, including wolves and dogs, has undergone a series of disrupting mutations in this gene, rendering PRDM9 inactive. Given the importance of PRDM9, it is of great interest to learn how its absence in the dog genome affects patterns of recombination placement. We have used genotypes from domestic dog pedigrees to generate sex-specific genetic maps of recombination in this species. On a broad scale, we find that placement of recombination events in dogs is consistent with that in mice and apes, in that the majority of recombination occurs toward the telomeres in males, while female crossing over is more frequent and evenly spread along chromosomes. It has been previously suggested that dog recombination is more uniform in distribution than that of humans; however, we found that recombination in dogs is less uniform than in humans. We examined the distribution of recombination within the genome, and found that recombination is elevated immediately upstream of the transcription start site and around CpG islands, in agreement with previous studies, but that this effect is stronger in male dogs. We also found evidence for positive crossover interference influencing the spacing between recombination events in dogs, as has been observed in other species including humans and mice. Overall our data suggests that dogs have similar broad scale properties of recombination to humans, while fine scale recombination is similar to other species lacking PRDM9.},

	abstract = {Abstract Crossing over is well known to have profound effects on patterns of genetic diversity and genome evolution. Far less direct attention has been paid to another distinct outcome of meiotic recombination: noncrossover gene conversion (NCGC). Crossing over and NCGC both shuffle combinations of alleles, and this degradation of linkage disequilibrium (LD) has major evolutionary consequences, ranging from immediate effects on nucleotide diversity to long-term consequences that shape genome evolution, species formation and species persistence. Unlike simple crossing over, NCGC has the potential to alter allele frequencies. Gene conversion can also occur in genomic regions where crossing over does not, and it purportedly exhibits more uniform rates across genomes. Considerable progress has been made towards understanding the mechanisms of gene conversion, and this progress enables us to begin exploring how gene conversion affects processes such as molecular evolution and interspecies gene flow. These topics are timely with the recent shift in focus from a primarily neutral null model of molecular evolution and speciation to one incorporating base levels of selection, making it all the more crucial to understand the basis and evolutionary implications of linkage. Here, we discuss the impact of gene conversion on genome structure and evolution and the current methods for detecting these events. We provide a comprehensive review of how gene conversion breaks down LD and affects both short- and long-term evolutionary processes, and we contrast its impact to that expected from crossing over alone.},

We show that our composite-likelihood approach allows one to study evolutionary models of arbitrary complexity, which cannot be tackled by other current likelihood-based methods. For simple scenarios, our approach compares favorably in terms of accuracy and speed with , the current reference in the field, while showing better convergence properties for complex models. We first apply our methodology to non-coding genomic SNP data from four human populations. To infer their demographic history, we compare neutral evolutionary models of increasing complexity, including unsampled populations. We further show the versatility of our framework by extending it to the inference of demographic parameters from SNP chips with known ascertainment, such as that recently released by Affymetrix to study human origins. Whereas previous ways of handling ascertained SNPs were either restricted to a single population or only allowed the inference of divergence time between a pair of populations, our framework can correctly infer parameters of more complex models including the divergence of several populations, bottlenecks and migration. We apply this approach to the reconstruction of African demography using two distinct ascertained human SNP panels studied under two evolutionary models. The two SNP panels lead to globally very similar estimates and confidence intervals, and suggest an ancient divergence (>110 Ky) between Yoruba and San populations. Our methodology appears well suited to the study of complex scenarios from large genomic data sets.},

    abstract = {Demographic models built from genetic data play important roles in illuminating prehistorical events and serving as null models in genome scans for selection. We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic variants within and between populations. For candidate models we numerically compute the expected spectrum using a diffusion approximation to the one-locus, two-allele Wright-Fisher process, involving up to three simultaneous populations. Our approach is a composite likelihood scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the variance but not the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We thus use bootstraps incorporating linkage to estimate uncertainties for parameters and significance values for hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on single sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles among populations experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions, migrations, and admixture. We model human expansion out of Africa and the settlement of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding DNA resequenced in 68 individuals from 4 populations (YRI, CHB, CEU, and MXL) by the Environmental Genome Project. We infer divergence between West African and Eurasian populations 140 thousand years ago (95% confidence interval: 40–270 kya). This is earlier than other genetic studies, in part because we incorporate migration. We estimate the European (CEU) and East Asian (CHB) divergence time to be 23 kya (95% c.i.: 17–43 kya), long after archeological evidence places modern humans in Europe. Finally, we estimate divergence between East Asians (CHB) and Mexican-Americans (MXL) of 22 kya (95% c.i.: 16.3–26.9 kya), and our analysis yields no evidence for subsequent migration. Furthermore, combining our demographic model with a previously estimated distribution of selective effects among newly arising amino acid mutations accurately predicts the frequency spectrum of nonsynonymous variants across three continental populations (YRI, CHB, CEU).},

Here, we introduce msprime version 1.0, which efficiently implements ancestry and mutation simulations based on the succinct tree sequence data structure and the tskit library. We summarize msprime’s many features, and show that its performance is excellent, often many times faster and more memory efficient than specialized alternatives.

  abstract     = {The explosion in population genomic data demands ever more complex modes of analysis, and increasingly, these analyses depend on sophisticated simulations. Recent advances in population genetic simulation have made it possible to simulate large and complex models, but specifying such models for a particular simulation engine remains a difficult and error-prone task. Computational genetics researchers currently re-implement simulation models independently, leading to inconsistency and duplication of effort. This situation presents a major barrier to empirical researchers seeking to use simulations for power analyses of upcoming studies or sanity checks on existing genomic data. Population genetics, as a field, also lacks standard benchmarks by which new tools for inference might be measured. Here, we describe a new resource, stdpopsim, that attempts to rectify this situation. Stdpopsim is a community-driven open source project, which provides easy access to a growing catalog of published simulation models from a range of organisms and supports multiple simulation engine backends. This resource is available as a well-documented python library with a simple command-line interface. We share some examples demonstrating how stdpopsim can be used to systematically compare demographic inference methods, and we encourage a broader community of developers to contribute to this growing resource.},

The past 12 months have seen a burst of genome sequences from non-model organisms, in each case representing a fundamental source of data of significant importance to biological research. This has bearing on several aspects of evolutionary biology, and we are now beginning to see patterns emerging from these studies. These include significant heterogeneity in the rate of recombination that affects adaptive evolution and base composition, the role of population size in adaptive evolution, and the importance of expansion of gene families in lineage-specific adaptation. Moreover, resequencing of population samples (population genomics) has enabled the identification of the genetic basis of critical phenotypes and cast light on the landscape of genomic divergence during speciation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Over the past decade, the field of population genomics has developed across nonmodel organisms, and the results of this research have begun to be applied in conservation and management of wildlife species. Genomics tools can provide precise estimates of basic features of wildlife populations, such as effective population size, inbreeding, demographic history and population structure, that are critical for conservation efforts. Moreover, population genomics studies can identify particular genetic loci and variants responsible for inbreeding depression or adaptation to changing environments, allowing for conservation efforts to estimate the capacity of populations to evolve and adapt in response to environmental change and to manage for adaptive variation. While connections from basic research to applied wildlife conservation have been slow to develop, these connections are increasingly strengthening. Here we review the primary areas in which population genomics approaches can be applied to wildlife conservation and management, highlight examples of how they have been used, and provide recommendations for building on the progress that has been made in this field.},

The field of conservation genetics aims at preserving species by using their levels of genetic diversity, usually measured as neutral genome-wide diversity, as a barometer for evaluating population health and extinction risk. A fundamental assumption is that higher levels of genetic diversity lead to an increase in fitness and long-term survival of a species. Here, we argue against the perceived importance of neutral genetic diversity for the conservation of wild populations and species. We demonstrate that no simple general relationship exists between neutral genetic diversity and the risk of species extinction. Instead, a better understanding of the properties of functional genetic diversity, demographic history, and ecological relationships is necessary for developing and implementing effective conservation genetic strategies.},

Comparison of physical and genetic maps reveals variation on a scale of megabases, with substantial differences between sexes. Recombination is often suppressed near centromeres and elevated near telomeres, but neither of these observations is true for all chromosomes. In humans, patterns of linkage disequilibrium and experimental measures of recombination from sperm-typing reveal dramatic hotspots of recombination on a scale of kilobases. Genome-wide variation in the amount of crossing-over may be due to variation in the density of hotspots, the intensity of hotspots, or both. Theoretical models of selection and linkage predict that genetic variation will be reduced in regions of low recombination, and this prediction is supported by data from several species. Heterogeneity in rates of crossing-over provides both an opportunity and a challenge for identifying disease genes: as associations occur in blocks, genomic regions containing disease loci may be identified with relatively few markers, yet identifying the causal mutations is unlikely to be achieved through associations alone.},

Advances in laboratory procedures, sequencing and genotyping technologies in the past decades have resulted in massive increases in high-quality genome-wide genetic data from present-day populations and allowed retrieval of genetic data from archaeological material, also known as ancient DNA. This has resulted in an explosion of work exploring past changes in population size, structure, continuity and movement. However, as genetic processes are highly stochastic, patterns of genetic variation only indirectly reflect demographic histories. As a result, past demographic processes need to be reconstructed using an inferential approach. This usually involves comparing observed patterns of variation with model expectations from theoretical population genetics. A large number of approaches have been developed based on different population genetic models that each come with assumptions about the data and underlying demography. In this article I review some of the key models and assumptions underlying the most commonly used approaches for past demographic inference and their consequences for our ability to link the inferred demographic processes to the archaeological and climate records.

@article{Teshima2006,
  abstract        = {The beneficial substitution of an allele shapes patterns of genetic variation at linked sites. Thus, in principle, adaptations can be mapped by looking for the signature of directional selection in polymorphism data. In practice, such efforts are hampered by the need for an accurate characterization of the demographic history of the species and of the effects of positive selection. In an attempt to circumvent these difficulties, researchers are increasingly taking a purely empirical approach, in which a large number of genomic regions are ordered by summaries of the polymorphism data, and loci with extreme values are considered to be likely targets of positive selection. We evaluated the reliability of the "empirical" approach, focusing on applications to human data and to maize. To do so, we considered a coalescent model of directional selection in a sensible demographic setting, allowing for selection on standing variation as well as on a new mutation. Our simulations suggest that while empirical approaches will identify several interesting candidates, they will also miss many - in some cases, most - loci of interest. The extent of the trade-off depends on the mode of positive selection and the demographic history of the population. Specifically, the false-discovery rate is higher when directional selection involves a recessive rather than a co-dominant allele, when it acts on a previously neutral rather than a new allele, and when the population has experienced a population bottleneck rather than maintained a constant size. One implication of these results is that, insofar as attributes of the beneficial mutation (e.g., the dominance coefficient) affect the power to detect targets of selection, genomic scans will yield an unrepresentative subset of loci that contribute to adaptations. {\textcopyright}2006 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

@article{Blischak2020,
  abstract        = {Demographic inference using the site frequency spectrum (SFS) is a common way to understand historical events affecting genetic variation. However, most methods for estimating demography from the SFS assume random mating within populations, precluding these types of analyses in inbred populations. To address this issue, we developed a model for the expected SFS that includes inbreeding by parameterizing individual genotypes using beta-binomial distributions. We then take the convolution of these genotype probabilities to calculate the expected frequency of biallelic variants in the population. Using simulations, we evaluated the model's ability to coestimate demography and inbreeding using one- and two-population models across a range of inbreeding levels. We also applied our method to two empirical examples, American pumas (Puma concolor) and domesticated cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata), inferring models both with and without inbreeding to compare parameter estimates and model fit. Our simulations showed that we are able to accurately coestimate demographic parameters and inbreeding even for highly inbred populations (F = 0.9). In contrast, failing to include inbreeding generally resulted in inaccurate parameter estimates in simulated data and led to poor model fit in our empirical analyses. These results show that inbreeding can have a strong effect on demographic inference, a pattern that was especially noticeable for parameters involving changes in population size. Given the importance of these estimates for informing practices in conservation, agriculture, and elsewhere, our method provides an important advancement for accurately estimating the demographic histories of these species.},

Another key goal to pursue the conservation of endangered species is keeping the connectivity across fragmented environments, to which genetic inferences of gene flow and dispersal greatly contribute. Most current statistical tools for estimating such population demographic parameters are based on Kingman's coalescent (KC). However, KC is inappropriate for taxa displaying skewed reproductive variance, a property widely observed in natural species. Coalescent models that consider skewed reproductive success - called multiple merger coalescents (MMCs) - have been shown to substantially improve estimates of Ne when the distribution of offspring per capita is highly skewed. MMCs predictions of standard population genetic parameters, including the rate of loss of genetic variation and the fixation probability of strongly selected alleles, substantially depart from KC predictions. These extended models also allow studying gene genealogies in a spatial continuum, providing a novel theoretical framework to investigate spatial connectivity. Therefore, development of statistical tools based on MMCs should substantially improve estimates of population demographic parameters with major conservation implications.},

Here we present lessons learned from generating assemblies for 16 species that represent six major vertebrate lineages. We confirm that long-read sequencing technologies are essential for maximizing genome quality, and that unresolved complex repeats and haplotype heterozygosity are major sources of assembly error when not handled correctly. Our assemblies correct substantial errors, add missing sequence in some of the best historical reference genomes, and reveal biological discoveries. These include the identification of many false gene duplications, increases in gene sizes, chromosome rearrangements that are specific to lineages, a repeated independent chromosome breakpoint in bat genomes, and a canonical GC-rich pattern in protein-coding genes and their regulatory regions. Adopting these lessons, we have embarked on the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), an international effort to generate high-quality, complete reference genomes for all of the roughly 70,000 extant vertebrate species and to help to enable a new era of discovery across the life sciences.},

We create detailed and comprehensive annotation of gene structures, regulatory elements and variants, and enable comparative genomics by inferring the evolutionary history of genes and genomes. Our integrated genomic data are made available in a variety of ways, including genome browsers, search interfaces, specialist tools such as the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor, download files and programmatic interfaces. Here, we present recent Ensembl developments including two new website portals. Ensembl Rapid Release (http://rapid.ensembl.org) is designed to provide core tools and services for genomes as soon as possible and has been deployed to support large biodiversity sequencing projects. Our SARS-CoV-2 genome browser (https://covid-19.ensembl.org) integrates our own annotation with publicly available genomic data from numerous sources to facilitate the use of genomics in the international scientific response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also report on other updates to our annotation resources, tools and services. All Ensembl data and software are freely available without restriction.}},

  abstract = {{This paper introduces AlphaSimR, an R package for stochastic simulations of plant and animal breeding programs. AlphaSimR is a highly flexible software package able to simulate a wide range of plant and animal breeding programs for diploid and autopolyploid species. AlphaSimR is ideal for testing the overall strategy and detailed design of breeding programs. AlphaSimR utilizes a scripting approach to building simulations that is particularly well suited for modeling highly complex breeding programs, such as commercial breeding programs. The primary benefit of this scripting approach is that it frees users from preset breeding program designs and allows them to model nearly any breeding program design. This paper lists the main features of AlphaSimR and provides a brief example simulation to show how to use the software.}},

It has been studied by two different approaches: mutation accumulation and mutagenesis experiments, and the analysis of DNA sequence data. The proportion of mutations that are advantageous, effectively neutral and deleterious varies between species, and the DFE differs between coding and non-coding DNA. Despite these differences between species and genomic regions, some general principles have emerged: advantageous mutations are rare, and those that are strongly selected are exponentially distributed; and the DFE of deleterious mutations is complex and multi-modal.},

However, despite its importance, the degree of dominance in natural populations is poorly quantified. Here, we leverage multiple mating systems in natural populations of Arabidopsis to co-estimate the distribution of fitness effects and dominance coefficients of new amino acid changing mutations. We find that more deleterious mutations are more likely to be recessive than less deleterious mutations. Further, this pattern holds across gene categories, but varies with the connectivity and expression patterns of genes. Our work argues that dominance arises as a consequence of the functional importance of genes and their optimal expression levels.},

	abstract = {Small and isolated wildlife populations face numerous threats to extinction, among which is the deterioration of fitness due to an accumulation of deleterious genetic variation. Genomic tools are increasingly used to quantify the impacts of deleterious variation in small populations; however, these approaches remain limited by an inability to accurately predict the selective and dominance effects of individual mutations. Computational simulations of deleterious genetic variation offer an alternative and complementary tool that can help overcome these limitations, though such approaches have yet to be widely employed. In this Perspective, we aim to encourage conservation genomics researchers to adopt greater use of computational simulations to aid in quantifying and predicting the threat that deleterious genetic variation poses to extinction. We first provide an overview of the components of a simulation of deleterious genetic variation, describing the key parameters involved in such models. Next, we clarify several misconceptions about an essential simulation parameter, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations, and review recent debates over what the most appropriate DFE parameters are. We conclude by comparing modern simulation tools to those that have long been employed in population viability analysis, weighing the pros and cons of a {\textquoteleft}genomics-informed{\textquoteright} simulation approach, and discussing key areas for future research. Our aim is that this Perspective will facilitate broader use of computational simulations in conservation genomics, enabling a deeper understanding of the threat that deleterious genetic variation poses to biodiversity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Recent studies have shown that this Neanderthal DNA is depleted around functional genomic regions; this has been suggested to be a consequence of harmful epistatic interactions between human and Neanderthal alleles. However, using published estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational fitness effects, we infer that Neanderthals had at least 40\% lower fitness than humans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal introgression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict a residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-Africans, leading to a fitness reduction of at least 0.5\%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans. We also show that if many deleterious mutations are recessive, the Neanderthal admixture fraction could increase over time due to the protective effect of Neanderthal haplotypes against deleterious alleles that arose recently in the human population. This might partially explain why so many organisms retain gene flow from other species and appear to derive adaptive benefits from introgression.}",

We present a non-parametric method for accurately estimating recent effective population size by using inferred long segments of identity by descent (IBD). We found that inferred segments of IBD contain information about effective population size from around 4 generations to around 50 generations ago for SNP array data and to over 200 generations ago for sequence data. In human populations that we examined, the estimates of effective size were approximately one-third of the census size. We estimate the effective population size of European-ancestry individuals in the UK four generations ago to be eight million and the effective population size of Finland four generations ago to be 0.7 million. Our method is implemented in the open-source IBDNe software package.}

Their inference scheme utilizes geographically...In continuous populations with local migration, nearby pairs of individuals have on average more similar genotypes than geographically well-separated pairs. A barrier to gene flow distorts this classical pattern of isolation by distance. Genetic similarity is decreased for sample pairs on different sides of the barrier and increased for pairs on the same side near the barrier. Here, we introduce an inference scheme that uses this signal to detect and estimate the strength of a linear barrier to gene flow in two dimensions. We use a diffusion approximation to model the effects of a barrier on the geographic spread of ancestry backward in time. This approach allows us to calculate the chance of recent coalescence and probability of identity by descent. We introduce an inference scheme that fits these theoretical results to the geographic covariance structure of bialleleic genetic markers. It can estimate the strength of the barrier as well as several demographic parameters. We investigate the power of our inference scheme to detect barriers by applying it to a wide range of simulated data. We also showcase an example application to an Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon) flower-color hybrid zone, where we do not detect any signal of a strong genome-wide barrier to gene flow.}",

There is evidence of significant variation in the levels of divergence between presumably neutral regions, pointing at an underlying variation in the rate of mutation across the genome. Apparently, such variation occurs on different scales, including sequence context effects (the influence of neighboring nucleotides on the rate of mutation at individual sites), variation within chromosomes (on the scales of kilobases as well as megabases), and between chromosomes (among autosomes as well as between autosomes and sex chromosomes). An important aspect for further research in this area is to study whether there is an ultimate evolutionary explanation for mutation rate variation within mammalian genomes.}

Here we review recent work that has both revealed the major mutation biases that operate across the genome and the molecular mechanisms that cause them. The default mutation rate landscape in mammalian genomes results in active genes having low mutation rates because of a combination of factors that increase DNA repair: early DNA replication, transcription, active chromatin modifications and accessible chromatin. Therefore, either an increase in the global mutation rate or a redistribution of mutations from inactive to active DNA can increase the rate at which consequential mutations are acquired in active genes. Several environmental carcinogens and intrinsic mechanisms operating in tumor cells likely cause cancer by this second mechanism: by specifically increasing the mutation rate in active regions of the genome.}
